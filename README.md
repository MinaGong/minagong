## About me
Hi there! I'm a calm and methodical Data Scientist with over 10 years of experience training data practitioners and transforming complex data into actionable insights using rigorous statistical analysis and machine learning. I'm an expert in predictive modeling, feature engineering, and survey design, and I'm fluent in Python, SQL, and R. I'm driven by a love of structured problem-solving and continuous learning, focused on helping teams make smarter, faster decisions by delivering clarity from raw data that drives real-world impact.

My goals are: To leverage my expertise in predictive modeling and statistical consulting to solve challenging, ambiguous problems in data science and continue to build tools that have a measurable impact on public health, finance, or business strategy.

My top skills are:

* Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost, model evaluation, feature selection
* Statistical Analysis: hypothesis testing, A/B testing, ANOVA, factor analysis, LDA
* Programming: Python (numpy, pandas, statsmodels), R, SQL
* Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, ggplot2, Tableau
* Cloud Tools: Google Big Query

I invite you to explore my projects. Feel free to email me at mathminagong@gmail.com with any questions or feedback!
